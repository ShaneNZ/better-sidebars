# Better Sidebars

Lets you drag a tab to the left/right edge of a pane in the left or right sidebar
to create a new side-by-side column there, the same way dragging to an edge in
the main editor area creates a new column. Dropping in the center of a pane (or
on its tab strip) still just stacks the dragged tab into that pane, unchanged.

## Why this exists / how it works

Obsidian's own tab-drag handler (`Workspace.prototype.onDragLeaf`, private/
undocumented) already builds sidebar splits through the exact same
`Workspace.splitLeaf()` path the main editor area uses - the split mechanism
itself was never restricted. It only *offers* top/bottom as candidate drop
directions in the sidebar; left/right are filtered out of the candidate list
before it reaches `Workspace.getDropDirection()`.

This plugin wraps that one method (`app.workspace.getDropDirection`) and, only
when the drop target lives in the left or right sidebar, strips `"left"` and
`"right"` back out of the excluded-directions list it's called with - so all
four directions become selectable there, exactly as in the main area. It does
not touch anything else: no other method is patched, no custom drag/drop
handling is added, and no CSS is shipped.

Confirmed with this technique on Obsidian 1.12.7. Because it depends on an
undocumented private method, a future Obsidian release could rename or
restructure it, which would make the patch a no-op (sidebar drags would just
fall back to core's current top/bottom-only behavior - this plugin doesn't
turn errors into anything worse) or, in principle, throw. If sidebar dragging
ever looks wrong after an Obsidian update, disable this plugin first to check.

## Disabling

Settings → Community plugins → Better Sidebars → toggle off, or run:

```
obsidian plugin:disable id=better-sidebars
```

## Rebuilding after editing src/main.ts

```
npm install
npm run build
```
then `obsidian plugin:reload id=better-sidebars`.
